# CS81 Module 7B – Daily Schedule Async Simulator

This project is part of **Module 7 Assignment 7B** for Santa Monica College's CS81 JavaScript Programming course.  
It demonstrates how to use JavaScript's `setTimeout` to simulate a personal daily routine, modeling the flow of asynchronous code and real-time progression through creative events and timing logic.

## Repository Structure

```
.
├── dailySimulation.html    # Main HTML file with timed event simulation
├── REFLECTION.md           # Final reflection answering assignment questions
└── README.md               # Project overview and usage instructions
```

## Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Git (for version control and GitHub submission)

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cs81-module7a-dailysim
cd cs81-module7a-dailysim
```

2. **Open the simulation**

Open the `dailySimulation.html` file in your browser. Events will begin animating automatically after a short delay.

## Features Included

- Sequential activity simulation using `setTimeout`
- 7 personal/creative activities shown with animated delays
- Randomized twists (moods, emojis, or surprises)
- Smooth background transition from morning blue to evening pink
- Styled layout and section-based display
- Detailed reflection on timing, challenges, and async design
